# EU AI Act Engineering

This repository provides the reference list for the emerging term "AI Act Engineering". 

**[EU AI Act](https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/)** regulates the development, deployment, and use of AI systems within the European Union. It aims to promote *trustworthy AI* by mitigating risks and ensuring fundamental rights are protected.

We define the term **"AI Act Engineering"** as a set of engineering practices that ensure AI systems comply with the EU AI Act's regulations.

Engineering for the EU AI Act Compliance involves the following aspects:

 - **Risk Assessment:** Classifying AI systems based on their risk level (*unacceptable, high, limited, low*) as defined by the Act.
 - **Mitigating High Risks:** For high-risk systems, implementing safeguards like robust data management, human oversight mechanisms, and explainable AI techniques.
 - **Documentation and Transparency:** Properly documenting the AI system's development process and ensuring a level of transparency appropriate for the risk level
